                  1. The aging population has changed the landscape of our
                  world! WSU researchers are actively working to answer many
                  scientific questions about how we will adapt. Some of the
                  questions are:
                  <br />
                  a. What are the best evidence-based practices for increasing
                  healthspan? How will family relationships between older and
                  younger generations be affected by increased longevity? How
                  will we develop equitable policies and design and deliver
                  services that best support older adults and their families?
                  How will our communities adapt to an aging population? How can
                  we support people to age with dignity? How can older adults
                  stay engaged and connected?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  2. These are critical questions as we look to the future
                  because aging is the foundation for a healthy society! These
                  are just a few of the questions WSU researchers are trying to
                  answer. We need YOU!
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  3. Why should you be involved in gciCONNECT?
                  <br />
                  a. You have a unique chance to stand up and take action. Your
                  participation helps others and contributes to moving science
                  forward. You have the power to share your lived experiences
                  and make a difference - take an active role in society.

                  1. “Learn continually. There is always ‘one more thing’ to
                  learn!” - Steve Jobs
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  2. WSU’s educational mission is to help students become more
                  aware, engaged, and creative. WSU strives to make its
                  expertise available to anyone who seeks to benefit from it,
                  regardless of where they live, where they come from, what they
                  believe, or what their life experiences have been.

                  3. gciCONNECT aims to support lifelong learning and
                  intergenerational connections.
                  <br />
                  a. Do you have special skills, knowledge, or
                  background/training that you want to share with others? Do you
                  want to connect with students to enhance their learning and
                  stay engaged with a campus community? Sometimes faculty
                  members may be looking for mentorship opportunities within
                  their class, or guest speaker opportunities; or people to be
                  interviewed for a class project. Are you interested in
                  connecting with undergraduates? If so, we invite you to
                  complete our intake survey and we’ll follow up with you!

                  4. Outreach and Support
                  <br />
                  Outreach: share your knowledge and experienceof working with
                  the Granger Cobb Institute at Washington State University with
                  your family & peers.
                  <br />
                  Support: fund student scholarships or experiential learning
                  projects.
